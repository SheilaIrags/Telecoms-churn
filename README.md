# Analysis of Maven Communications

## Introduction

The project is based on the [Maven Churn Challenge](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-churn-challenge?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=churnchallengestoke1_li_maven).

As a Business Intelligence Analyst, you have been hired to help the company improve retention by identiying high value customers and churn risks, and have been asked to present your findings to the CMO in form of a single page report or dashboard.
